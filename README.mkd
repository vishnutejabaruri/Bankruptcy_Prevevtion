## Project Overview

This project aims to predict bankruptcy status for companies using machine learning classification models. The dataset contains various financial risk-related features. Our goal was to create a robust predictive model that helps determine whether a company is at risk of bankruptcy based on these factors.

We explored various machine learning algorithms, including classical methods and ensemble techniques, and finally built a **stacked model** that combines the strengths of all the individual models. This stacking model achieved an impressive **100% accuracy on both the training and test datasets**.

The project was developed as part of an internship, with a team of seven members, and deployed using **Flask** on **Render**.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of various financial and management-related features that influence a company's financial stability. Below are some of the key features:

- **Industrial Risk**
- **Management Risk**
- **Financial Flexibility**
- **Credibility**
- **Competitiveness**
- **Operating Risk**

The target variable is whether the company is bankrupt (`1`) or not (`0`).

## Modeling Approach

We built and evaluated several classification models to predict bankruptcy status. The models include:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Tree**
3. **Bagging**
4. **Random Forest**
5. **AdaBoost**
6. **Gradient Boosting**
7. **XGBoost**
8. **LightGBM**
9. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
10. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
11. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
12. **Naive Bayes**

### Individual Model Performance:
Each of these models was trained and evaluated individually, and all of them performed well on the dataset. The top performers were the ensemble methods like **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **LightGBM**, as well as the **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**.

## Stacked Model

To leverage the strengths of each model, we created a **stacked model**, which is an ensemble of all the models mentioned above. Stacking involves training a meta-model (also called a level-1 model) that combines the predictions of the base models (level-0 models).

### Meta-Model:
For the meta-model, we used **Logistic Regression** to aggregate the predictions from all the base models.

### Result:
The stacked model achieved **100% accuracy** on both the **training** and **test** datasets. This remarkable performance shows the power of combining models to create a more accurate and robust predictor.

## Model Evaluation

Here are the evaluation metrics for the stacked model:

- **Accuracy**: 100%
- **Precision**: 100%
- **Recall**: 100%
- **F1-Score**: 100%

The model was highly accurate in predicting both bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy cases, with no errors on the test set.

## Deployment

The project is deployed using **Flask** and hosted on **Render**. You can access the live application here:

**[Live Demo](https://bankruptcy-project-ww16.onrender.com/)**

In the web app, users can input risk factors for a company, and the model will predict whether the company is at risk of bankruptcy.
